## Overview

Built entirely with TypeScript and modern frontend technologies, this project is a client-side only (frontend) application—no backend or server-side code is included.

## Features

- **Course Management:** Create, update, and organize courses with modules, lessons, and resources (UI mockups).
- **Interactive Content:** Support for videos, PDFs, quizzes, and discussion forums (frontend components).
- **Progress Tracking:** Visualize student progress and reports (client-side only).
- **Responsive Design:** Seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Admin Dashboard:** UI for managing users, courses, and analytics.

## Tech Stack
